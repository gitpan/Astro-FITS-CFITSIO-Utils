Revision history for Perl extension Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::Utils.

0.13  Wed Dec 22 10:41:29 EST 2010
        - returned items are blessed into Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::Utils::Item,
	  rather than myItem, as that's bogus name space pollution.
	- fixed documentation which called the hdu_num attribute hdr_num.
	- routines can now take a handle to an opened file as well
	  as a file name

0.12  Mon Dec  6 12:29:01 EST 2010
        - colkeys wasn't finding all of the column associated
	  keywords.  It's now better at this, but may pick up some
	  that shouldn't be picked up.

0.11  Fri Apr 11 13:05:19 EDT 2008
        - distribution was missing the local Module::Install inc dir.

0.10  Thu Apr 10 17:17:15 EDT 2008
        - added colkeys.

		   Astro::FITS::CFITSIO::CheckStatus

0.06  Mon Feb 11 17:57:14 EST 2008
        - keywords weren't always treated in a case-insensitive fashion

0.04  Sat Mar  8 23:09:25 EST 2003
        - added multiple keywords, OnePerHDU flag.  Should be
	  backwards compatible.

0.03  Wed Jan 29 16:16:00 2003
	- convert to use a myItem, derived from an Astro::FITS::Headers::Item;
	  this adds an hdu_num method which records the HDU number in
	  which the keyword was found.
